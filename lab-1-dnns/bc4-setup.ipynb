    "\n",
    "   ![PuTTY credentials prompt](./media/bc4-setup/6-putty-connection.png)\n",
    "10. You should now see a username/password propmpt like the one above. Type in your user name (e.g. wp13824) and then enter your password. Beware your password characters *will not show up*, although the keypressed are being registered. You should then be met with a bash prompt on BC4.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Creating `authorized_keys`](./media/bc4-setup/7-authorized-keys.png)\n",
    "11. Create a folder `.ssh` in your BC4 home directory by running `mkdir -p .ssh`\n",

You can load your private key `id_rsa.ppk` into Pageant by double clicking on it. This will start a Pageant process if one is not already running creating an icon in the taskbar. You can see this in the above screenshot to the right of the ^ icon. \n",

This will open a file explorer in the start up folder. Open up another file explorer and navigate to the folder containing `id_rsa.ppk`. Right click the `id_rsa.ppk` file and click copy. Go back to the startup folder window and right-click and *paste a shortcut*. Now every time you login that file will be executed which will cause pageant to be launched and your private key to be loaded.\n",

    "    Open `cmd.exe` by typing *cmd* in the start menu seach bar. Type `echo \"hi\" > test.txt` to create our test.txt file. Now copy that file to BC4 by using `pscp`. The syntax of this command is `pscp <src> <user>@<host>:[<dest>]`. If `<dest>` is ommitted, then file will be copied to your home directory. Copy the `test.txt` file to your home directory by running `pscp test.txt <user>@bc4login.acrc.bris.ac.uk:`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "If `pscp` asks you for your password it means pageant is not configured correctly/not running. `pscp` will query pageant for private keys when it trys to log into a server."

    "of the machines in a super computer (there are 32 nodes in BC4 with dual P100 GPUs), these are the machines that *are* for running experiments. \n",
    "To run something on a compute node, you must wrap it up into a *job*. A job is simply a unit of work, e.g. a script. When you submit a job it is put into a queue of jobs from which compute nodes pull work from until there is none left (except there are always more jobs than machines to complete them!). \n",
